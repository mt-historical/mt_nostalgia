Minetest 0.4 mod: creative
==========================

Implements creative mode.

Switch on by using the "creative_mode" setting.

Registered items that
- have a description, and
- do not have the group not_in_creative_inventory
are added to the creative inventory.

There is a "creative" priv. If a player has it, they can use the creative inventory, even if the server is not in creative mode.
It also adds a trash slot to the survival inventory, and a "Clear Inventory" button to the creative inventory.
There is also a sort-of-hidden easter egg that I think VanessaE will like...
